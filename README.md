> An example website that shows repositories and build reports

## This repository is no longer being updated as it is obsolete due to Github Actions

The original goal of this repository was to provide a website where I can view the status of my various repositories. It was designed to be a sort of CI/CD dashboard that displayed metadata about a repository (using the Github API) and build reports (generated by my jenkins server and pushed to an S3 bucket).

Now that Github released Github Actions, I no longer need to make a custom interface to view my repository build reports, and I also don't need to run a jenkins CI/CD server as using Github Actions is more convenient.

## Features

- Uses React, and Redux for frontend
- Uses S3 to hold reports that were generated by jenkins on each build
- Extensive unit tests (see `src/components`)
- automated testing/deployment
- badges generated on the clientside using [local-badges](https://github.com/nikita-skobov/local-badges)
